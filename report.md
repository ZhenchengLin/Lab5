## Part-1
#### Question 1
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**
On macbook, using VScode.
#### Question 2
**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**
When I run Junit with the ArrayTest.java file it just shown this

It says it fail says file not found.
I was expected to see 2 test passed.

#### Question 3
**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
When I trying to use terminal to run my file ArrayTests.java class.
The input I put in is `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ArrayTests.java`
